# Getting Started

[ROC-RK3328-CC] supports booting from the following storage devices:
 - SD card
 - eMMC

You need to flash the firmware to SD card or eMMC, so as to make the board bootable after power up. 

[SDCard Installer] is the officially recommended SD card flashing tool, which is based on Etcher / Rock64 Installer, and implements one-stop downloading and flashing of firmware file. It makes life easy.

## Firmware Format

There are two firmware file formats:
 - raw firmware
 - Rockchip firmware
 
The `raw firmware`, when flashing, is copied to the storage device bit by bit. It is the raw image of the storage device. `Raw firmware` is flashed to SD card in common cases, but it can also be flashed to eMMC. There are lots of flashing tools available:
 - To flash to SD card:
   + CLI: dd (Linux)
   + GUI: Etcher (Linux/Windows/Mac), [SDCard Installer] (Linux/Windows/Mac), WinDD (Windows)
 - To flash to eMMC:
   + CLI: update_tool (Linux)ï¼Œrkdeveloptool (Linux)
   + GUI: android_tool (Windows)

The `Rockchip firmware`, is packed in Rockchip's proprietary format, which is flashed to eMMC via Rockchip's `update_tool` in Linux or `android_tool` in Windows. It is Rockchip's traditional packing format, commonly used in Rockchip Android firmware. The Rockchip Android firmware can also be flashed into SD card using [SD_Firmware_Tool].

Besides, when you build the Android SDK, you'll get a list of `boot.img`, `kernel.img`, `system.img`, etc, which is called `partition image file` and will be flashed to the corresponding partition. For example, `kernel.img` is to be flashed to `kernel` partition of eMMC or SD card.
