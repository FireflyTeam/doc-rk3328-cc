# Getting Started

[ROC-RK3328-CC] supports booting from the following storage devices:
 - SD card
 - eMMC

If you're using SD card to boot the board, and your host OS is Windows, visit straightly to 
[Flashing Firmware to SD Card in Windows](flash_sd_windows.html). Using the official flashing tool [SDCard Installer] has made everything simple and easy with a few clicks.

If you would like to know more detail or prefer to offline firmware flashing, then go ahead.

## Firmware Format

There are two firmware file formats used:
 - raw firmware
 - Rockchip firmware
 
The `raw firmware`, is the on-disk format, which means that it should be copied to storage devices bit by bit. In Linux, you can use the `dd` command directly to flash this type of firmware. While in Windows, you can use graphics tool like [Etcher], or [SDCard Installer] which is derived from the Rock64 installer and [Etcher].

The `Rockchip firmware`, is the firmware file packed in Rockchip's proprietary format, which shall be flashed to eMMC using Rockchip's `update_tool` in Linux or `android_tool` in Windows. It can also be flashed into SD card using Rockchip's [SD_Firmware_Tool].

`Rockchip firmware` can be converted to `raw firmware`, and vice versa. That sounds confused at first. But `Rockchip firmware` is the traditional firmware format for all Rockchip devices, especially in case of Android OS. And `raw firmware` is more suitable and natural for SD card flashing.

When you build the Android SDK, you'll get a list of `boot.img`, `kernel.img`, `system.img`, etc, which is called `partition image file` and will be flashed into the corresponding partition. For example, `kernel.img` is to be flashed to `kernel` partition of eMMC or SD card.
